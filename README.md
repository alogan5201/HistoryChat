This is a react-native application, where users can engage in simulated conversations with historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., and Albert Einstein.

This project was bootstrapped from the [ignite](https://github.com/infinitered/ignite) boilerplate boilerplate provided by [Infinite Red](https://infinite.red).

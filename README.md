# History Chat

This is a react-native application, where users can engage in simulated conversations with historical figures such as Abraham Lincoln, Martin Luther King Jr., and Albert Einstein. Leveraging the power of Generative AI such as ChatGPT, this app is a testament to my ability to merge advanced AI with seamless mobile development. Experience history through modern tech innovation.
